# DXtest_repo

Test repo to demonstrate an ability to write and iterate on scripts prior to starting at DX. 

The script determines if there have been PR's, who created and merged them, and then includes data such as changes and time stamps. 

Running the script results in a .csv of this data in a digestible format.
